### Character-recognition-Through-Deep-Learning

This is a basic character recognition deep learning model. 
I have implemented this with reference to the code in the book "Deep Learning with Python" with some improvments of my own.

It takes a while to download the mnist database depending on the speed of the internet connection. 

This can be used in different projects such as automatic NPR systems etc for further analysis.
